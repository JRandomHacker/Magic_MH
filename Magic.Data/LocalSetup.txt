LocalSetup.cs needs to be created and should contain something like this (Correct password):

namespace Magic.Data.LocalSetup
{
	public class Constants
	{
		private static readonly string azureConnection = "Data Source=kmagic.database.windows.net;Initial Catalog=kmagic;User ID=kmagic;Password=PASSWORDHERE";
		public static readonly string currentConnectionString = azureConnection;
	}
}
